# Recordstack

### What is it?
Well, ideally, it's a way to search for and track records you want to listen to and haven't got around to yet. But not yet. It's also a way for me to get my feet wet with Rails development, soooo it's probably going to be really really rough.

### Sounds pretty cool.
Really?

### No.
Oh. Sorry.
